**❄️ Ski Dashboard – Project Overview
**1. Project Title / Headline****

**Snowy Analytics: Global Ski Resort Insights Dashboard**
A dynamic Power BI dashboard designed to explore worldwide ski resort data, compare regions, analyze terrain levels, and understand skier suitability across different continents.

**2. Short Description / Purpose**
The Snowy Analytics Dashboard provides an interactive overview of 499 ski resorts across 38 countries and 5 continents. It highlights key resort features such as summer skiing availability, night skiing, family-friendly options, slope difficulty, elevation levels, and lift infrastructure. This dashboard helps travelers, analysts, and tourism companies make data-driven decisions about ski destinations.

**3. Tech Stack**

Power BI Desktop – Main platform for visualization and dashboard creation
Power Query – Used for data cleaning, shaping, and transformation
DAX – For calculated measures, KPIs, and dynamic filtering logic
Data Modeling – Relationship building between resort, snow, and dictionary tables
File Format – .pbix for the report, .png for dashboard export

**4. Data Source**

The dataset covers ~500 ski resorts worldwide, including details on slopes, lifts, terrain difficulty, continent & country classification, season types (summer/winter), and elevation points. Additional snow-cover data for 2022 improves environmental context.

**5. Key Features / Highlights**

**• Business Problem**
There is no quick and intuitive way to compare global ski resorts by terrain, family-friendliness, lift availability, and region. Travelers, tourism agencies, and analysts struggle to identify the best destinations based on specific preferences.

**• Goal of the Dashboard**
To build an interactive visual tool that:
Helps users compare ski resorts globally
Supports tourism market analysis and strategic planning
Reveals patterns in terrain, elevation, and infrastructure
Enables data-driven vacation planning and investment decisions
